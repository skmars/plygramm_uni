## Trying best practises with FastApi

Working on one project but in different perspectives.
This is a work horse to try something new.
A lot of time here is going to be spent to testing.

## Tech

Open source projects will be used to work properly:

- [FastApi] - fast framework suitable for async
- [PostgreSQL] -  most popular RDB
- [SQLAlchemy] - powerfull ORM
- [ALembic] - lightweight database migration tool
- [Pytest] - popular python testing tool
- [Docker] - Docker container to install and deploy
- [Uvicorn] - ASGI web server
- [Pydantic] -  compatable serializer
- [flake8, black] - main linters
